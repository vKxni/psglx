# Psglx :: Nostrum 
A random AI for your server, made for private and fun usage.

## 👩🏻‍💼 Getting started 

1. Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`.
2. Rename `.env.example` to `.env`.
3. Add your token and optionally developer guild id to the `.env` file.

## 👩🏻‍🏫 Information
> Versions
* You **need** OTP Version 23 or higher. Latest Version is fine too, just not below 23/22.

> Deployment
* You do not need to push the commands, it is automatically done once you run the bot. 

## 🚴🏻 Up and running
> Shell commands
```
$ iex -S mix
```
This will start the bot, if you make any additional changes you you have to stop the terminal with `CTRL + C` and then run the same iex command again. I might add auto-refresh later.

> Bot commands
```
/ping
/random 
/goodmorning
/goodnight
```
Ping returns a simple "Ping Pong" while random returns a random quote from the `random.txt` file. You can modify that if you want like add more quotes/messages/facts ...
